    $studentMessage = "Dear Student,

You will be aware that your attendance has not been good and as a result your status in your Personal Learning Plan (PLP) has changed and you have been put at risk or the level of risk of your not achieving your qualification has been increased. You need to take action to address this and we need to discuss this with you to agree actions you will take to improve your attendance. We need you to attend all of your classes on time. We will monitor your attendance and should you fail to attend more than two of your classes in the next month we will need to take further action with you to recover your learning.

If you have supplied the College with a valid reason for your non attendance then will take this into account, however it still means that you have missed valuable learning.

Please make contact with your Personal Tutor to agree the actions you will be taking to address your poor attendance.

MidKent College.
