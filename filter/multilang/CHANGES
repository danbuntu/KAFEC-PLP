	* filter.php: 
	
	
	New extended multilang filter!
	
	Now does lang replacement for each "langblock" (many lang-enabled
	tags bunched together with only whitespace between), allowing:
	
	  * Multiple langblocks per filtered text
	  * Non-lang-translated content before, after, and between
	langblocks
	
	This should be solving bugs 2878 and 2879. Buy one, get one free.

2005-04-29 Friday 00:33  stronk7

	* filter.php: 
	
	Now we support both uppercase and lowercase lang tags, and the
	separator can be both the hypen and the underscore characters. 
	Everything is converted to Moodle's (lowercase with hypen) langs.
	
	And the filter returns the full text if some exception happens (bad
	build lang tags). Actually it was returning an empty string on
	error.
	
	Should we be a stricter allowing only the correct langs????

2005-04-28 Thursday 06:17  stronk7

	* filter.php: 
	
	Now multilang filter supports both the <lang lang="XX> and the
	<span lang="XX"> syntaxes. Bug 3057.

	Improvement to filters, providing speed boost AND better
	compatibility with Turck MMCache.
