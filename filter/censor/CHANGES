	* filterconfig.html:

	MDL-7861

	* filterconfig.html: 
	
	Added ability to reset to default. Bug #4123

2005-08-26 Friday 16:33  thepurpleblob

	* README.txt, filter.php, filterconfig.html: 
	
	If no custom list is specified, the default list from the language
	pack will be used instead. It works out-of-the-box (again!).

	* filter.php: 
	
	Merged from stable

2005-07-30 Saturday 16:54  moodler

	* filter.php: 
	
	Added original word as title to the blacked-out version.  This is
	because the filter can obscure actual important words by mistake
	(eg Dickens) and there needs to be some way to recover the meaning.

2005-07-26 Tuesday 21:06  thepurpleblob

	* README.txt, filterconfig.html: 
	
	Added configuration screen for bad words list.

2005-07-26 Tuesday 21:05  thepurpleblob

	* filter.php: 
	
	Provide setup screen for the censor bad words list. Note that for
	decencies sake, I have decided to start with a blank word list
	rather than use the provided one which may shock the unwary!

	* filter.php: 
	
	Changed to use the new replacementphrase attribute so bad words are
	replaced with a strlen(phrase) number of **** characters. Bug 3605
	(http://moodle.org/bugs/bug.php?op=show&bugid=3605)
	
	Merged from MOODLE_15_STABLE

2005-03-05 Saturday 11:32  moodler

	* filter.php:

	  - now blacks out words using styles
	  - gets the words from the language pack

2004-08-08 Sunday 14:57  moodler

	* filter.php: 
	
	Improvement to filters, providing speed boost AND better
	compatibility with Turck MMCache.
	
	Filter function must now have a particular name
	
	   eg resource_filter
	
	where "resource" is the name of the directory that filter.php is
	in.
