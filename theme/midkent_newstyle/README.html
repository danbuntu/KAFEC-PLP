<p>This theme is based on the new Midkent College website</p>

<p>Orginal theme design by Nat Munckton</p>

<p>Converted into a Moodle theme by Dan Attwood</p>

<p>Menubar scripts from the Newbury College theme created by Shaun Daubney</p>

<p>Date based logo change scripts by Dan Attwood</p>

<p>Addtional icons from the Tango and Breathe Icon sets licensed under the GPL</p>

<h3>Date changer notes</h3>

<p>The date changer uses the code in datachange.php to actually change the logo based on the information in dates.xml.</p>

<p>In order to add new dates you will need to copy and paste a block of xml (defined by <item> and </item>).</p>

<p>You can alter the date, name and logo and text fields.</p>

<p>Note: You will need to include multiple section for ranges of dates, Ie. one section for each date in the range</p>

The logos must be stored in the 'logos' folder. Included in this folder
is a photoshop file with all the layers and graphics used to build the
default set of logos include in the theme. You can use this file to
create branding for your own site.

<p>To use the datechanger in your own custom theme you will need to copy datechange.php and dates.xml into your theme folder.</p>

<p>You then need to add '<?php include 'datechange.php'; ?>' to your header.html file in the appropiate place.</p>

<p>Note you will likly need to add this in two places, one for the fornt page and one for every other page in the site.</p><p></p>
    
<h3>Menu Bar notes</h3>

<p>The menu bar is driven by menubar.php. You will need to edit this and alter all links to include your own</p>

<p>You might also want to retheme it using styles_menubar.css</p>
