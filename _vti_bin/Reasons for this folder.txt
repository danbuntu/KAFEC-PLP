This folder and the 0 byte files within it, along with _vti_inf.html and MSOffice folder in the folder above this one, are 
here to stop errors building up in the error log. Internet Explorer and some Microsoft Office 
applications will request FrontPage extensions, regardless of whether it needs them or they are on the 
server. This generates file could not be found errors. These dummy files elimanate those errors and keep 
the logs clearer for real errors.
