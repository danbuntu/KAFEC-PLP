	are working hard on these .. .the reason for getting this into HEAD
	at this stage is enable us to move faster (our branch was diverging
	from HEAD too much).

	status and information for developers on how to use the new Roles
	system.

	alt tags in radio buttons were breaking display it they contain
	lang tags. Now they are filtered against strip_tags() and processed

	In vertical display, format_text() was using format_text
	(FORMAT_PLAIN), not sure why and it was breaking multilang support,
	replacing all <> to their htmlentities().

	* lib.php: 
	
	Variety of small fixes, but mostly related to how the recent
	activity block is constructed.	A new function exists to pump these
	notes out in a standard way :  print_recent_activity_note.
	
	Module dependencies also updated because of this.

2005-03-09 Wednesday 17:50  bawjaws

	* view.php:

	* mod.html: 
	
	Give groupmode selection to mod.html for all modules that use
	groupmode. Also fix bug 2576

2005-02-16 Wednesday 18:40  gustav_delius

	* report.php, version.php, view.php: 
	
	In order to ensure that when a teacher hides a resource or an
	activity that students really can't get at it, even if they know
	the direct links to its pages, I have given an optional third
	argument $cm to the functions  require_login() and
	require_course_login(). Pages showing information about a
	particular course module now pass the course module object in this
	third argument. The login functions will then test if either the
	course module is visible or the user is a teacher. If neither is
	the case then the user is redirected to the course homepage after
	being shown a message "Sorry, this activity is currently hidden".
	
	(While I was at it I also turned the autologinguests off for most
	module pages, except on the index.php pages and the view.php pages
	for those modules that allow guests)

2005-02-13 Sunday 14:31  moodler

	* mod.html: 
	
	Choice doesn't have groups

2005-02-13 Sunday 08:42  stronk7

	* lib.php:

2005-02-13 Sunday 05:41  gustav_delius

	* mod.html: 
	
	Activities can now be hidden/shown from the activity editing page.
	Also for modules that know about groups the groupmode can be set
	from there. See bug 2533. This required adding to the mod.html
	files calls to new functions print_visible_setting() and
	print_groupmode_setting() which are combined in
	print_standard_coursemodule_settings().
	
	The visibility of coursemodules is now always set through the
	function set_coursemodule_visible() in order to make sure that the
	associated events get updated in the calendar appropriately.
	
	If moving a coursemodule to a hidden section then the module is set
	to hidden as well and its events are hidden in the calendar.
	
	If deleting a coursemodule its events are deleted from the
	calendar.
	
	The function choose_from_menu() has an extra optional argument
	$disabled which, when set to true, will disable the menu.
	
	For the sake of consistency the function set_groupmode_for_module
	has been renamed to set_coursemodule_groupmode and the functions
	show_course_module() and hide_course_module() have been combined to
	set_coursemodule_visible().

2005-02-10 Thursday 01:15  moodler

	All the page headers work correctly also on the site course.
	
	On the site page the modules don't require login unless necessary
	or required by $CFG->forcelogin.

2004-07-01 Thursday 21:30  moodler

	* mod.html, version.php: 
	
	BRANCH MERGE
	
	These are the changes from MOODLE_13_STABLE, merged into trunk
	
	The tag MOODLE_13_MERGED on the MOODLE_13_STABLE branch now refers
	to this point
	
	The biggest changes here are the fixes for HTML editor in all
	standard modules

2004-06-03 Thursday 21:07  moodler

	* mod.html, version.php: 
	
	OK, for bug fixes this is a pretty big checkin!!   :-/
	
	I finally was able to see the HTML Editor bug in IE/XP that
	everyone was talking about, and it's a very serious bug as it makes
	Moodle 1.3 almost unusable for these people.  :-(  :-(
	
	So, I eventually found out that the problem is that the Javascript
	that attaches the editor has troubles when it is embedded within
	the table						    that
	course/mod.php puts around the mod.html forms in each module. 
	(Only in IE and only sometimes, mind you).
	
	While testing I also had a good look at a long standing issue which
	is the inconsistency of the mod.html forms when using the editor.
	
	So, to fix both I decided to put the HTML editor calls OUTSIDE the
	mod.html in the mod.php file.  This means that all modules get the
	HTML editor by default on all text areas during activity module
	setup by default.
	
	I've been running through this for the past few hours and it seems
	pretty stable now and a lot more consistent, so I'm checking it in
	as big fix towards the Moodle 1.3.1 we have to have.
	
	Unfortunately it also means the API has changed a bit  ... I had to
	update all the module dependencies to this exact version (or
	later).
	
	Please test this "stable" version hard using the standard modules
	only and I'll merge these changes over to the trunk in a day or so
	and update all known third-party modules.

2004-03-14 Sunday 09:22  stronk7

	* view.php: 
	
	Avoid some division by 9 warnings when showing anonymously and no
	answers have been introduced.

2003-05-20 Tuesday 17:33  moodler

	* report.php, view.php: 
	
	get_course_users now calls get_site_users if the course is a site.
	
	There is something wrong with this SQL still though ... it mostly
	works but I'm still getting wierd behaviour with small numbers of
	users.
	
	Need some help here ...  for example just look at get_site_users()
	on your test site.
	
	It's supposed to return a list of users who are admins, creators,
	teachers or students

2003-05-20 Tuesday 16:03  moodler

	* mod.html: 
	
	Minor code cleanups

	level.
	
	PLus some HTML lowercasing

2003-05-16 Friday 02:03  moodler

	* view.php: 
	
	I knew there was something else I'd forgotten!
	
	Added a check to all modules (well view.php anyway) to check
	whether a module is hidden or not.  If it is, then students get a
	message.

2003-04-25 Friday 00:47  stronk7

	* index.php: 
	
	Changed to show the hidden choices dimmed (bug #364)

2003-01-15 Wednesday 18:55  moodler

	* report.php:

2003-01-02 Thursday 22:49  moodler

	* view.php: 
	
	buggy_referer is dead!	 Long live buggy_referer!
	
	Should be fixed now.  As a bonus, I've removed all the uses of
	HTTP_POST_VARS from all scripts.
	
	All forms should use the new data_submitted() function to collect
	form data (it does the match_referer thing internally now).
	
	Much nicer.

2003-01-01 Wednesday 14:34  moodler

	* column.png, index.php, lib.php, mod.html, version.php, view.php,
	db/mysql.php, db/mysql.sql, db/postgres7.php, db/postgres7.sql:

2002-12-23 Monday 17:39  moodler

	* index.php, lib.php, report.php, version.php, view.php,
	db/mysql.php, db/mysql.sql, db/postgres7.php, db/postgres7.sql: 
	
	Changes throughout Moodle to remove any reserved words from the
	Moodle tables.
	
	ie user -> userid in many tables, plus in user_students    start ->
	starttime and end -> endtime
	
	I've just done all this as carefully as I could ... I don't think I
	missed anything but it's pretty intensive work and I'd be fooling
	myself if I didn't think I'd missed a couple.
	
	Note that this version should pretty much be able to bootstrap
	itself using PostgreSQL now ... but this is untested

2002-12-20 Friday 22:44  moodler

	* index.php, lib.php, view.php, db/mysql.sql: 
	
	Many many changes lumped in here ... not finished yet either.
	
	Basically all the Database functions are in lib/datalib.php and the
	web functions are all in lib/weblib.php, so moodlelib.php is much
	thinner than it was.
	
	Data functions have been extended ... most old calls will still
	work, but now many more SQL commands can be performed using the
	datalib functions rather than using SQL.  I'm currently moving
	through the whole tree replacing SQL calls or at least
	concentrating them in one section of mod/xxx/lib.php
	
	Still working on forums, quizzes, surveys, resources.
	
	The tree is currently not full working ... some things are
	half-completed ... will resume tomorrow.

2002-12-15 Sunday 10:41  moodler

	stage.

2002-10-24 Thursday 11:43  moodler

	* version.php, db/mysql.php:

2002-08-03 Saturday 10:29  martin

	Moved all mod.php functions from modules into lib.php, and updated
	course/mod.php to use them there.  No longer need module/mod.php

2002-08-03 Saturday 01:42  martin

	* version.php: 
	
	Removed fullname and search fields from modules table.	Fullname is
	now derived from the string 'modulename' in the lang files for each
	module.

2002-08-01 Thursday 13:34  martin

	* mod.php: 
	
	Clean up - modernised choice mod.php

2002-07-31 Wednesday 22:19  martin

	* module.php, version.php: 
	
	OK, some massive changes with many files removed or changed.
	
	Basically the changes are:
	
	 - I've merged the 'discuss' module into the forum module
	   which makes the interface MUCH clearer for everyone
	 - I've added a new 'single' forum type that replicates
	   what the old discuss course modules used to look like.
	 - I've got rid of the "discussion" forum type - it will
	   still exist in upgraded courses but as a normal forum.
	 - the 'discuss' module is completely deleted - gone.
	 - the 'chat' module is completely deleted - gone.
	 - The upgrading system has been improved, and all code
	   is stored in version.php.
	 - I've put in upgrading commands to do the best I can
	   (right now) to upgrade courses that used the discuss
	   module.  It should mostly work, just leaving some
	   "orphan" coursemodules on you course front page.  You
	   can easily delete these using the little 'x'.
	   I may have forgotten something  - I've only tested on
	   my testing server and I'm about to test on my production
	   server to see how it goes.
	 - Forums have a lot of little new features and fixes.	The
	   main one is the subscription process.  Teachers can 'force'
	   subscriptions on any forum.	This disallows everyone from
	   choosing their own mail subscription - it's just on.
	 - The assignment module is half-finished and not working yet
	
	I've still some massive changes to do, mostly involving making all
	the lib.php function names more standardised, so consider this is
	an interim checkin to do some tests.

2002-07-27 Saturday 14:07  martin

	* module.php: 
	
	Changes to suit new upgrading procedure (admin/index.html)

2002-07-25 Thursday 21:48  martin

	* lib.php: 
	
	Got rid of the user.php code fragments and implemented much cleaner
	system which certain-named functions in lib.php ... called from
	/course/user.php

2002-07-21 Sunday 02:20  martin

	* index.php: 
	
	Slight formatting tweaks (forum index)

2002-07-04 Thursday 15:48  martin

	* view.php: 
	
	Fix to update_module_icon (to pass the courseid)

2002-06-26 Wednesday 00:42  martin

	* index.php: 
	
	Minor formatting tweaks

2002-06-25 Tuesday 19:49  martin

	* index.php, mod.html: 
	
	Major changes throughout to change "week" notation to "section"
	notation.  Sections covers "weeks", "topics" and anything else that
	may come along.  Note, again, some databases have changed esp
	course_weeks -> course_sections and several fields called "week"
	are now "section.  Also course no longer has an enddate, but
	instead has a numsections field.

2002-06-08 Saturday 14:52  martin

	* view.php: 
	
	Changes to put update/edit icons in the headers of module and
	course pages

2002-06-05 Wednesday 11:15  martin

	userdate() which itself uses the USER variable timezone to alter
	the displayed time.

2002-05-31 Friday 17:14  martin

	* db/mysql.sql: 
	
	Added new entries for log_display table.  These are used to define
	what to display for any given logged item.

2002-05-31 Friday 17:07  martin

	* index.php, install.sql, mod.html, report.php, view.php: 
	
	Various small fixes across all modules.  Most notable was the
	revised use of add_to_log, and the new logging format.

2002-05-31 Friday 17:03  martin

	* db/mysql.sql: 
	
	This is the new format for database schema.  Each module has a db
	directory with one file per database.  All these are called from
	admin/index.php and work in concert with lib/db.

2001-11-22 Thursday 14:23  martin

	* icon.gif, index.php, install.sql, mod.html, mod.php, module.php,
