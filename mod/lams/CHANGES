	ROLES AND PERMISSIONS  - FIRST CHECK-IN
	=======================================
	
	WARNING:  DEV IS CURRENTLY VERY UNSTABLE.
	
	This is a mega-checkin of the new Roles system.   A lot of changes
	have been made in core and modules.
	
	Currently there are a lot of rough edges and known problems.  We
	are working hard on these .. .the reason for getting this into HEAD
	at this stage is enable us to move faster (our branch was diverging
	from HEAD too much).
	
	Please keep an eye on http://docs.moodle.org/en/Roles for current
	status and information for developers on how to use the new Roles
	system.
