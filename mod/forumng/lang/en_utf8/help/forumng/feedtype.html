<h1>ForumNG</h1>

<h2>Feed contents</h2>

<p>
The forum offers access via Atom and RSS feeds. These are an alternative to
email subscriptions that also allow users, by using appropriate software or 
websites, to stay current with forum messages.  
</p>

<p><small>
Note: There is no practical difference between Atom and RSS; these are two 
different formats that achieve the same task.
</small></p>

<p>There are three possible choices:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Feed disabled</strong> - Atom and RSS feeds are not available for
this forum.</li>
<li><strong>Contains discussions only</strong> - The feeds only contain
top-level discussions and do not include replies to those discussions.</li>
<li><strong>Contains all posts</strong> - Both discussions and replies are
included in feeds.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Feeds contain full text of posts, not just the subject lines or abbreviated
versions. Different feed reading software or websites may display
feeds in different ways.
</p>

<p>
This option can be disabled at site level in the system settings. If the option
is fixed in system settings, then all forums receive the same setting. If the
option is not fixed, then it can be changed on each individual forum.
