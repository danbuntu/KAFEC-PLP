<h2>Automatically / manually marking discussions read</h2>

<p>
Click the <strong>Change</strong> option to toggle between automatically, 
or manually, marking discussions as read.
</p>

<p>
When you have not yet read posts, they display with a different background
colour and other effects so that you can tell they are unread. This setting
controls how such posts are marked read, losing their special appearance.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
By default, discussions are <strong>automatically</strong> marked read
whenever you view them.
If you view a discussion containing unread posts, the system
assumes you are going to read those posts, so it marks them read. The next time
you view the discussion, they will be shown as normal read posts.
</li>
<li>
If you like, you can change it so that you <strong>manually</strong> mark
discussions read. When you finish reading a discussion, click the 
<strong>Mark discussion read</strong> button at the bottom of the discussion
page. You can also use the tick mark icons or the <strong>Mark all posts
read</strong> button on the discussion list.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The automatic/manual option affects all forums.
