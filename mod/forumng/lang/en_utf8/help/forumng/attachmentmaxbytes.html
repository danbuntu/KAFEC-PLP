<h1>ForumNG</h1>

<h2>Maximum attachment size</h2>

<p>
Forum attachments are limited in size. This can help reduce problems caused
for users downloading large files (slow downloads) and is especially important
where some users do not have broadband internet access. It also reduces 
pressure on system storage. Finally, it can reduce abuse of the forums: 
for example, even with a fairly generous 5MB limit, you can't attach
copyrighted movies or video games.
</p>

<p>
The size limit applies per file, not per post or per user. For example,
if the size limit is 5MB, you can attach three 4MB files to a message.
</p>

<p>
This option can be disabled at site level in the system settings. If the option
is fixed in system settings, then all forums receive the same setting. If the
option is not fixed, then it can be changed on each individual forum.
