<h1>ForumNG</h1>

<h2>Share this forum</h2>

<p>
If you enable this option in forum settings, the forum can be 'shared' with
other courses by choosing with the 'Use existing shared forum' link when
creating a forum.
</p>

<p>
Shared forums appear exactly the same in each course, but students in each
course use the permissions of their own course to access the forum. They don't
need to have permission to access the course of the original forum.
</p>

<p>
When you share a forum, you must specify a unique 'ID number' value. This value
will be used to refer to the forum when creating a link to it from another
course.
</p>

<p>
You cannot share forums that use any of the following features:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Group mode (though you can use groupings to control access).</li>
<li>Graded ratings.</li>
</ul>

<p>
When a forum is shared, the options in the 'Restrict availability' section
apply only to the original forum link and not to any other locations where
the forum might be shared.
