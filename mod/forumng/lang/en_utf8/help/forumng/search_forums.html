<h1>ForumNG</h1>

<h2>Search forums</h2>

<p>
Type one or more words and hit search to search all forums on this website at
once. 
</p>
<p>
The search behaves in exactly the same manner as when searching a single forum,
but includes all the forums that are visible to you.
</p>
<p>
For example, you could match posts which contain the word frog, do not contain 
the word jump, and contain the phrase ‘ribbit ribbit’ by typing 
<strong> frog –jump "ribbit ribbit" </strong>into this box.
