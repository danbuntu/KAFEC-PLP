<h1>ForumNG</h1>

<h2>Move discussions to</h2>

<p>Choose what you want to do with removed discussions.</p>

<h3>Delete permanently</h3>

<p>The default option <strong>Delete permanently</strong> will delete these discussions.</p> 
<p>Ordinarily, when a moderator deletes a post, the post is not 'really' deleted; it can be restored. 
This is not the case for automatically deleted discussions, which are <strong>permanently deleted</strong> and cannot be recovered.</p>

<h3>Move to another forum</h3>

<p>Alternatively, you can select a forum in this course to move these discussions into. For example, some teachers like to create
a hidden 'Archive forum' which is used to store old discussions.</p>

<p>You can only move discussions to a forum with compatible group settings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Discussions can always be moved into a forum set to <strong>No groups</strong>.</li>
<li>If the target forum is set to <strong>Separate groups</strong> or <strong>Visible groups</strong>, then it must have the 
same grouping as the source (current) forum.</li>
</ul>
