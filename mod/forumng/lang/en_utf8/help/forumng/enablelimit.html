<h2>Limit user posting</h2>

<p>
In some specialised forum use it might be helpful to limit the number of posts
by an individual user. This feature provides that option.
</p>

<p>
You can choose the number of posts a user is limited to, and the time period
(day, 2 days, week, or fortnight). The time period is always considered from
current rather than as discrete units; for example, if you are limited to 
10 posts per one day and you make 10 posts on 23:00 one day, you cannot make 
another post until 23:00 the next day.
</p>

<p>
When users have 3 or fewer 'remaining' posts and go to make a new one, 
a warning displays. When they have no remaining posts, an error appears 
instead. The error tells them the date and time at which they will next be 
allowed to post.
</p>

<p>
Users with the <tt>mod/forumng:ignorethrottling</tt> capability are not
affected by post limits.
