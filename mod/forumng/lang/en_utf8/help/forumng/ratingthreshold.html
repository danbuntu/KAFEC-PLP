<h2>Required ratings</h2>

<p>
If this option is set (to anything other than 1), ratings for a post will not 
be displayed until at least this number of different people have rated it.

This is probably most useful when allowing students to rate posts because it
means one vindictive student can't immediately give a bad rating to someone's
post.
