<h1>ForumNG</h1>

<h2>Use existing shared forum</h2>

<p>
If you choose this option, you must type the ID number of an existing shared
forum.
</p>

<p>
A link to the shared forum will then be created instead of a new forum. Most
options on this form will be ignored; however, availability and (manual only)
completion options will continue to work.
