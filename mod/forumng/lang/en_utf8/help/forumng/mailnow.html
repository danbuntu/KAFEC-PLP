<h2>Mail now</h2>

<p>
The <strong>Mail now</strong> option (which is usually not available to 
students) causes the system to send your post to email subscribers more quickly.
</p>

<p>
Choosing <strong>Mail now</strong> does not send your post by email to more 
people, or send a copy to you. It only causes existing emails, which would
have been sent anyway, to be sent more quickly.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Ordinarily the system waits a certain time before mailing posts, in case
the author decides to edit the post. The time delay is the same as the editing
timeout, set in admin settings.</li>
<li>If you set <strong>Mail now</strong> then the system does not intentionally
wait at all and any emails will be included in the next batch. On most systems 
this will still involve a short delay (usually between five minutes and half 
an hour).</li>
</ul>
