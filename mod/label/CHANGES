	ROLES AND PERMISSIONS  - FIRST CHECK-IN
	=======================================
	
	WARNING:  DEV IS CURRENTLY VERY UNSTABLE.
	
	This is a mega-checkin of the new Roles system.   A lot of changes
	have been made in core and modules.
	
	Currently there are a lot of rough edges and known problems.  We
	are working hard on these .. .the reason for getting this into HEAD
	at this stage is enable us to move faster (our branch was diverging
	from HEAD too much).
	
	Please keep an eye on http://docs.moodle.org/en/Roles for current
	status and information for developers on how to use the new Roles
	system.

	can still get flushed to the browser when necessary but not print
	<li>s everywhere.  Please test this!

	These are the changes from MOODLE_13_STABLE, merged into trunk
	
	The tag MOODLE_13_MERGED on the MOODLE_13_STABLE branch now refers
	to this point
	
	The biggest changes here are the fixes for HTML editor in all
	standard modules

2004-06-03 Thursday 21:07  moodler

	* mod.html, version.php: 
	
	OK, for bug fixes this is a pretty big checkin!!   :-/
	
	I finally was able to see the HTML Editor bug in IE/XP that
	everyone was talking about, and it's a very serious bug as it makes
	Moodle 1.3 almost unusable for these people.  :-(  :-(
	
	So, I eventually found out that the problem is that the Javascript
	that attaches the editor has troubles when it is embedded within
	the table						    that
	course/mod.php puts around the mod.html forms in each module. 
	(Only in IE and only sometimes, mind you).
	
	While testing I also had a good look at a long standing issue which
	is the inconsistency of the mod.html forms when using the editor.
	
	So, to fix both I decided to put the HTML editor calls OUTSIDE the
	mod.html in the mod.php file.  This means that all modules get the
	HTML editor by default on all text areas during activity module
	setup by default.
	
	I've been running through this for the past few hours and it seems
	pretty stable now and a lot more consistent, so I'm checking it in
	as big fix towards the Moodle 1.3.1 we have to have.
	
	Unfortunately it also means the API has changed a bit  ... I had to
	update all the module dependencies to this exact version (or
	later).
	
	Please test this "stable" version hard using the standard modules
	only and I'll merge these changes over to the trunk in a day or so
	and update all known third-party modules.
