	ROLES AND PERMISSIONS  - FIRST CHECK-IN
	=======================================
	
	WARNING:  DEV IS CURRENTLY VERY UNSTABLE.
	
	This is a mega-checkin of the new Roles system.   A lot of changes
	have been made in core and modules.
	
	Currently there are a lot of rough edges and known problems.  We
	are working hard on these .. .the reason for getting this into HEAD
	at this stage is enable us to move faster (our branch was diverging
	from HEAD too much).
	
	Please keep an eye on http://docs.moodle.org/en/Roles for current
	status and information for developers on how to use the new Roles
	system.

	Backup_flush checks a different constant, this is so that output
	can still get flushed to the browser when necessary but not print
	<li>s everywhere.  Please test this!

	* backuplib.php, restorelib.php:

	all the variables to the script, so the agree system, wasn't
	working at all.  Bug 2724
	(http://moodle.org/bugs/bug.php?op=show&bugid=2724)

	Variety of small fixes, but mostly related to how the recent
	activity block is constructed.	A new function exists to pump these
	notes out in a standard way :  print_recent_activity_note.
	
	Module dependencies also updated because of this.

2005-03-10 Thursday 08:28  stronk7

	* assessments.php: 
	
	HTTP_POST_VARS present some problems under PHP5 (deprecated,
	configuration needed). Used $_POST (with data_submitted(), if
	possible) instead.  NOTE: Detected in a lot of places!

2005-03-10 Thursday 08:15  stronk7

	* backuplib.php:

2005-03-07 Monday 19:32  moodler

	* mod.html: 
	
	Give groupmode selection to mod.html for all modules that use
	groupmode. Also fix bug 2576

2005-02-16 Wednesday 18:40  gustav_delius

	* assess.php, assessments.php, index.php, submissions.php,
	upload.php, version.php, view.php, viewassessment.php: 
	
	In order to ensure that when a teacher hides a resource or an
	activity that students really can't get at it, even if they know
	the direct links to its pages, I have given an optional third
	argument $cm to the functions  require_login() and
	require_course_login(). Pages showing information about a
	particular course module now pass the course module object in this
	third argument. The login functions will then test if either the
	course module is visible or the user is a teacher. If neither is
	the case then the user is redirected to the course homepage after
	being shown a message "Sorry, this activity is currently hidden".
	
	(While I was at it I also turned the autologinguests off for most
	module pages, except on the index.php pages and the view.php pages
	for those modules that allow guests)

2005-02-13 Sunday 21:12  gustav_delius

	* assess.php, assessments.php, submissions.php, upload.php,

	* lib.php: 
	
	Now retrieving only needed fields!

2005-02-13 Sunday 05:41  gustav_delius

	* mod.html: 
	
	Activities can now be hidden/shown from the activity editing page.
	Also for modules that know about groups the groupmode can be set
	from there. See bug 2533. This required adding to the mod.html
	files calls to new functions print_visible_setting() and
	print_groupmode_setting() which are combined in
	print_standard_coursemodule_settings().
	
	The visibility of coursemodules is now always set through the
	function set_coursemodule_visible() in order to make sure that the
	associated events get updated in the calendar appropriately.
	
	If moving a coursemodule to a hidden section then the module is set
	to hidden as well and its events are hidden in the calendar.
	
	If deleting a coursemodule its events are deleted from the
	calendar.
	
	The function choose_from_menu() has an extra optional argument
	$disabled which, when set to true, will disable the menu.
	
	For the sake of consistency the function set_groupmode_for_module
	has been renamed to set_coursemodule_groupmode and the functions
	show_course_module() and hide_course_module() have been combined to
	set_coursemodule_visible().

	* mod.html, version.php: 
	
	BRANCH MERGE
	
	These are the changes from MOODLE_13_STABLE, merged into trunk
	
	The tag MOODLE_13_MERGED on the MOODLE_13_STABLE branch now refers
	to this point
	
	The biggest changes here are the fixes for HTML editor in all
	standard modules

2004-06-03 Thursday 21:07  moodler

	* mod.html, version.php: 
	
	OK, for bug fixes this is a pretty big checkin!!   :-/
	
	I finally was able to see the HTML Editor bug in IE/XP that
	everyone was talking about, and it's a very serious bug as it makes
	Moodle 1.3 almost unusable for these people.  :-(  :-(
	
	So, I eventually found out that the problem is that the Javascript
	that attaches the editor has troubles when it is embedded within
	the table						    that
	course/mod.php puts around the mod.html forms in each module. 
	(Only in IE and only sometimes, mind you).
	
	While testing I also had a good look at a long standing issue which
	is the inconsistency of the mod.html forms when using the editor.
	
	So, to fix both I decided to put the HTML editor calls OUTSIDE the
	mod.html in the mod.php file.  This means that all modules get the
	HTML editor by default on all text areas during activity module
	setup by default.
	
	I've been running through this for the past few hours and it seems
	pretty stable now and a lot more consistent, so I'm checking it in
	as big fix towards the Moodle 1.3.1 we have to have.
	
	Unfortunately it also means the API has changed a bit  ... I had to
	update all the module dependencies to this exact version (or
	later).
	
	Please test this "stable" version hard using the standard modules
	only and I'll merge these changes over to the trunk in a day or so
	and update all known third-party modules.
