	underlying index will be created.  - Please, put comments inside
	each table/field/key/index field, mainly because   XML comments
	will be deleted if the file is edited by - The XMLDB Editor. Please
	use it ;-) - Also, one unique index was wrong in the XML file,

	=======================================
	
	WARNING:  DEV IS CURRENTLY VERY UNSTABLE.
	
	This is a mega-checkin of the new Roles system.   A lot of changes
	have been made in core and modules.
	
	Currently there are a lot of rough edges and known problems.  We
	are working hard on these .. .the reason for getting this into HEAD
	at this stage is enable us to move faster (our branch was diverging
	from HEAD too much).
	
	Please keep an eye on http://docs.moodle.org/en/Roles for current
	status and information for developers on how to use the new Roles
	system.

	Backup_flush checks a different constant, this is so that output
	can still get flushed to the browser when necessary but not print
	<li>s everywhere.  Please test this!

	It wasn' working fine because the wiki_pages table hadn't an id
	(primary key) field.
	
	I've created, in the upgrade process, a temporary table to copy all
	the wiki_pages records and then, drop and create again the table.
	
	Tested under MySQL. Need to be tested (both creation and upgrade)
	under PostgreSQL!!!
	
	Minor modifications to ewikimoodlelib.php to work with this new id
	field too. Seems to work although deeper tests will be welcome
	(attachements, binary contents...)

2005-02-16 Wednesday 18:40  gustav_delius

	* admin.php, version.php, view.php: 
	
	In order to ensure that when a teacher hides a resource or an
	activity that students really can't get at it, even if they know
	the direct links to its pages, I have given an optional third
	argument $cm to the functions  require_login() and
	require_course_login(). Pages showing information about a
	particular course module now pass the course module object in this
	third argument. The login functions will then test if either the
	course module is visible or the user is a teacher. If neither is
	the case then the user is redirected to the course homepage after
	being shown a message "Sorry, this activity is currently hidden".
	
	(While I was at it I also turned the autologinguests off for most
	module pages, except on the index.php pages and the view.php pages
	for those modules that allow guests)

2005-02-13 Sunday 05:41  gustav_delius

	* mod.html: 
	
	Activities can now be hidden/shown from the activity editing page.
	Also for modules that know about groups the groupmode can be set
	from there. See bug 2533. This required adding to the mod.html
	files calls to new functions print_visible_setting() and
	print_groupmode_setting() which are combined in
	print_standard_coursemodule_settings().
	
	The visibility of coursemodules is now always set through the
	function set_coursemodule_visible() in order to make sure that the
	associated events get updated in the calendar appropriately.
	
	If moving a coursemodule to a hidden section then the module is set
	to hidden as well and its events are hidden in the calendar.
	
	If deleting a coursemodule its events are deleted from the
	calendar.
	
	The function choose_from_menu() has an extra optional argument
	$disabled which, when set to true, will disable the menu.
	
	For the sake of consistency the function set_groupmode_for_module
	has been renamed to set_coursemodule_groupmode and the functions
	show_course_module() and hide_course_module() have been combined to
	set_coursemodule_visible().
