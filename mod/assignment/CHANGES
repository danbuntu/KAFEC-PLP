	SWEEPING CLEANUP
	
	The API was changed slightly so that has_capability now takes the
	whole $context object (we almost always have it anyway)
	
	The $kill thing was removed.   If you want to assert a capability
	then use:
	
	    require_capability('capname', $context);
	
	with optional variables to modify the error message
	
	Misc bugs here and there also removed and code tidied

	ROLES AND PERMISSIONS  - FIRST CHECK-IN
	=======================================
	
	WARNING:  DEV IS CURRENTLY VERY UNSTABLE.
	
	This is a mega-checkin of the new Roles system.   A lot of changes
	have been made in core and modules.
	
	Currently there are a lot of rough edges and known problems.  We
	are working hard on these .. .the reason for getting this into HEAD
	at this stage is enable us to move faster (our branch was diverging
	from HEAD too much).
	
	Please keep an eye on http://docs.moodle.org/en/Roles for current
	status and information for developers on how to use the new Roles
	system.

	Where does that leave us? The popup does not die anymore, BUT:
	
	1. It throws a notice about $sort not being defined (to be
	expected) 2. It doesn't use the correct sortorder ($sort is not
	defined, so default sort)

	This has been pretty well tested by Yu and myself, but since Yu

	Refactored Assignment Module ============================
	
	This new assignment module allows Plugin Assignment types.  This
	should allow a whole lot of new stuff to easily be placed in Moodle
	without making the modules list longer for no good reason.
	
	This checkin is still a really rough version that needs work on it.
	 Normally I would want it better than this to check in, but I need
	to collaborate with Shane on the remaining code and CVS is the best
	way.
	
	Give it a day or two to settle in.  :-)
	
	This is the last thing I wanted to get into 1.5.  Getting close
	now!!
	
	Cheers! Martin

2005-04-13 Wednesday 15:45  moodler

2005-04-13 Wednesday 07:42  stronk7

	* restorelib.php: 
	
	Now all the wiki formated texts are converted to markdown by the
	restore process. Such conversion is performed for every backup file
	prior to 2005041100.  Wiki internal links are dinamically changed
	and then, converted to Markdown. Bye, Wiki! ;-)

2005-04-11 Monday 20:44  thepurpleblob

2005-04-02 Saturday 19:32  stronk7

	* lib.php: 
	
	Now course/recent.php works under PHP5.  See bug 2828
	(http://moodle.org/bugs/bug.php?op=show&bugid=2828)

	view.php: 
	
	Now assignment->name works under filterall.

	* view.php: 
	
	Standardise the intro box using an ID

2005-03-10 Thursday 21:30  moodler

	* lib.php, version.php: 
	
	Variety of small fixes, but mostly related to how the recent
	activity block is constructed.	A new function exists to pump these
	notes out in a standard way :  print_recent_activity_note.
	
	Module dependencies also updated because of this.

2005-03-07 Monday 19:31  moodler

	* lib.php: 
	
	Removed files/mimetype.php and put it into lib/filelib.php instead
	where it always should have been.

	Removing these to avoid confusion.
	
	Yes, my assignment refactoring is going to make it into 1.5

2005-02-16 Wednesday 18:40  gustav_delius

	* submissions.php, upload.php, version.php, view.php: 
	
	In order to ensure that when a teacher hides a resource or an
	activity that students really can't get at it, even if they know
	the direct links to its pages, I have given an optional third
	argument $cm to the functions  require_login() and
	require_course_login(). Pages showing information about a
	particular course module now pass the course module object in this
	third argument. The login functions will then test if either the
	course module is visible or the user is a teacher. If neither is
	the case then the user is redirected to the course homepage after
	being shown a message "Sorry, this activity is currently hidden".
	
	(While I was at it I also turned the autologinguests off for most
	module pages, except on the index.php pages and the view.php pages
	for those modules that allow guests)

2005-02-14 Monday 08:05  gustav_delius

	* index.php: 
	
	Fix bug 1998

2005-02-13 Sunday 08:42  stronk7

	* lib.php: 
	
	Now retrieving only needed fields!

2005-02-13 Sunday 05:41  gustav_delius

	* mod.html: 
	
	Activities can now be hidden/shown from the activity editing page.
	Also for modules that know about groups the groupmode can be set
	from there. See bug 2533. This required adding to the mod.html
	files calls to new functions print_visible_setting() and
	print_groupmode_setting() which are combined in
	print_standard_coursemodule_settings().
	
	The visibility of coursemodules is now always set through the
	function set_coursemodule_visible() in order to make sure that the
	associated events get updated in the calendar appropriately.
	
	If moving a coursemodule to a hidden section then the module is set
	to hidden as well and its events are hidden in the calendar.
	
	If deleting a coursemodule its events are deleted from the
	calendar.
	
	The function choose_from_menu() has an extra optional argument
	$disabled which, when set to true, will disable the menu.
	
	For the sake of consistency the function set_groupmode_for_module
	has been renamed to set_coursemodule_groupmode and the functions
	show_course_module() and hide_course_module() have been combined to
	set_coursemodule_visible().

2005-02-10 Thursday 18:41  moodler

	Email alerts to teachers ------------------------
	
	Added a small new feature to the assignment module to alert
	teachers when new emails come in.  This feature adds one new field
	(which is tested) but the operation of the new code has not been
	tested yet at all (apart from PHP syntax) and very likely has bugs
	in it.
	
	I'm checking this in so I can do tests on test.moodle.com which has
	email set up properly.
	
	I'm off to bed right now but if anyone else wants to test this
	feature before tomorrow please do!   :-)
	
	While I'm rambling here in CVS, I need to have a good look soon at
	Pablo's work on Assignment and see if I can merge it all in...

	The biggest changes here are the fixes for HTML editor in all
	standard modules

2004-06-03 Thursday 21:07  moodler

	* mod.html, version.php: 
	
	OK, for bug fixes this is a pretty big checkin!!   :-/
	
	I finally was able to see the HTML Editor bug in IE/XP that
	everyone was talking about, and it's a very serious bug as it makes
	Moodle 1.3 almost unusable for these people.  :-(  :-(
	
	So, I eventually found out that the problem is that the Javascript
	that attaches the editor has troubles when it is embedded within
	the table						    that
	course/mod.php puts around the mod.html forms in each module. 
	(Only in IE and only sometimes, mind you).
	
	While testing I also had a good look at a long standing issue which
	is the inconsistency of the mod.html forms when using the editor.
	
	So, to fix both I decided to put the HTML editor calls OUTSIDE the
	mod.html in the mod.php file.  This means that all modules get the
	HTML editor by default on all text areas during activity module
	setup by default.
	
	I've been running through this for the past few hours and it seems
	pretty stable now and a lot more consistent, so I'm checking it in
	as big fix towards the Moodle 1.3.1 we have to have.
	
	Unfortunately it also means the API has changed a bit  ... I had to
	update all the module dependencies to this exact version (or
	later).
	
	Please test this "stable" version hard using the standard modules
	only and I'll merge these changes over to the trunk in a day or so
	and update all known third-party modules.

	* config.html, lib.php, mod.html:

	1) There is a new site-wide configuration variable called maxbytes,

	further    limits uploads within a course.

	restricts    the size allowed in a particular forum.  There is also
	a new config	variable in the module configuration to specify a
	default size	to use when defining a new forum.
	
	4) Assignments already had a limit, but this is now aware of the
	other	 limits, and like forums there is now a settable default
	value.

	translatable	in the language packs.

	* restorelib.php:

	* index.php: 
	
	When displaying index lists of a particular module's activities,

	Mail-outs for assignment and journal module are now translatable.

2003-04-28 Monday 23:52  moodler

	* lib.php, submissions.php: 
	
	Minor fixes

2003-04-26 Saturday 23:08  moodler

	* lib.php: 
	
	Trying a different tack for recent_activity since the old way was
	still producing too much data and overflowing PHP memory on busier
	sites (eg moodle.org).
	
	Now, there are more database queries, which is unfortunate, but the
	data is much more specific, and no sorting needs to be done, so
	this is a performance boost.
	
	I don't know how these will cancel out ... my guess is that very
	small sites may be very slightly slower on the course page, but
	that large sites will be much faster.
	
	Let's see.

2003-04-26 Saturday 20:59  moodler

	* lib.php: 
	
	Performance improvements
	
	  - better checking of data before processing

	  - don't keep re-parsing logs once they've been used

2003-04-26 Saturday 07:49  stronk7

	* lib.php: 
	
	Show activity log only from visible assignments. Bug #367.

	* lib.php:

	assignment is uploaded.  Bug fixed by Ray Kingdon.

2003-01-15 Wednesday 18:55  moodler

	* lib.php: 
	
	
	Displayed time formats are now stored in lang files (see the new
	strftime* strings) so they can be customised per language

2003-01-14 Tuesday 11:01  moodler

	* submissions.php: 
	
	For assignments without a timemodified stamp, add one when graded

2003-01-06 Monday 21:55  moodler

	Small robustness fixes

2003-01-05 Sunday 22:19  moodler

	include_once() and require() to require_once()

2003-01-05 Sunday 12:20  moodler

	* upload.php:

	strings.

2003-01-02 Thursday 22:49  moodler

	* submissions.php: 
	
	buggy_referer is dead!	 Long live buggy_referer!
	
	Should be fixed now.  As a bonus, I've removed all the uses of
	HTTP_POST_VARS from all scripts.
	
	All forms should use the new data_submitted() function to collect
	form data (it does the match_referer thing internally now).
	
	Much nicer.

2003-01-01 Wednesday 14:34  moodler

	* mod.html: 
	
	More robustness fixes

2002-12-30 Monday 01:32  moodler

2002-12-23 Monday 17:39  moodler

	* lib.php, submissions.php, upload.php, version.php, db/mysql.php,
	db/mysql.sql, db/postgres7.sql: 
	
	Changes throughout Moodle to remove any reserved words from the
	Moodle tables.
	
	ie user -> userid in many tables, plus in user_students    start ->
	starttime and end -> endtime
	
	I've just done all this as carefully as I could ... I don't think I
	missed anything but it's pretty intensive work and I'd be fooling
	myself if I didn't think I'd missed a couple.
	
	Note that this version should pretty much be able to bootstrap
	itself using PostgreSQL now ... but this is untested

2002-12-20 Friday 22:44  moodler

	* lib.php, view.php, db/mysql.sql: 
	
	Many many changes lumped in here ... not finished yet either.
	
	Basically all the Database functions are in lib/datalib.php and the
	web functions are all in lib/weblib.php, so moodlelib.php is much
	thinner than it was.
	
	Data functions have been extended ... most old calls will still
	work, but now many more SQL commands can be performed using the
	datalib functions rather than using SQL.  I'm currently moving
	through the whole tree replacing SQL calls or at least
	concentrating them in one section of mod/xxx/lib.php
	
	Still working on forums, quizzes, surveys, resources.
	
	The tree is currently not full working ... some things are
	half-completed ... will resume tomorrow.

2002-12-15 Sunday 10:41  moodler

	display files if timemodified is set ... workaround for possible
	bug

2002-11-12 Tuesday 12:59  moodler

	Added new type of assignment - offline.

	online, it just tells them about an assignment and the teacher can
	provide feedback and grades.  Useful for offline activities, and
	also for the teacher to add manual columns to the grades page

	* lib.php, version.php: 
	
	Moved uploaded assignment files into a subdirectory called moddata,
	where data from other modules can also live later on.
	
	Also added a README for that directory to warn teachers not to mess
	with it, version code to perform the upgrade, tweaks to
	assignment/lib.php and a tweak to reading module so that assignment
	files aren't listed in the list of possible readings (could get
	messy).

2002-08-26 Monday 17:48  martin

	* lib.php: 
	
	Changes to use a new configuration variable: CFG->slasharguments
	
	If true, then display of user pictures or filenames will use the
	method of providing arguments as "slash" arguments - this is much
	better for caching, proxies, search engines etc.  Unfortunately it

2002-07-31 Wednesday 22:19  martin

	* module.php, version.php: 
	
	OK, some massive changes with many files removed or changed.
	
	Basically the changes are:
	
	 - I've merged the 'discuss' module into the forum module
	   which makes the interface MUCH clearer for everyone
	 - I've added a new 'single' forum type that replicates
	   what the old discuss course modules used to look like.
	 - I've got rid of the "discussion" forum type - it will
	   still exist in upgraded courses but as a normal forum.
	 - the 'discuss' module is completely deleted - gone.
	 - the 'chat' module is completely deleted - gone.
	 - The upgrading system has been improved, and all code
	   is stored in version.php.
	 - I've put in upgrading commands to do the best I can
	   (right now) to upgrade courses that used the discuss
	   module.  It should mostly work, just leaving some
	   "orphan" coursemodules on you course front page.  You
	   can easily delete these using the little 'x'.
	   I may have forgotten something  - I've only tested on
	   my testing server and I'm about to test on my production
	   server to see how it goes.
	 - Forums have a lot of little new features and fixes.	The
	   main one is the subscription process.  Teachers can 'force'
	   subscriptions on any forum.	This disallows everyone from
	   choosing their own mail subscription - it's just on.
	 - The assignment module is half-finished and not working yet
	
	I've still some massive changes to do, mostly involving making all
	the lib.php function names more standardised, so consider this is
	an interim checkin to do some tests.
