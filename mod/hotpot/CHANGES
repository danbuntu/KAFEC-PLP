	ROLES AND PERMISSIONS  - FIRST CHECK-IN
	=======================================
	
	WARNING:  DEV IS CURRENTLY VERY UNSTABLE.
	
	This is a mega-checkin of the new Roles system.   A lot of changes
	have been made in core and modules.

	status and information for developers on how to use the new Roles
	system.
