	status and information for developers on how to use the new Roles
	system.

	When on, you see a third button when selecting a file, which lets
	you select a LOCAL file on your own filesystem (but it isn't
	uploaded).
	
	The local file is included in the web page when viewed.  All users
	see a link that helps them set up a user_preference for the
	location of these files on their own system (usually a CD_ROM
	drive).

2005-02-16 Wednesday 18:40  gustav_delius

	* fetch.php, lib.php, version.php: 
	
	In order to ensure that when a teacher hides a resource or an
	activity that students really can't get at it, even if they know
	the direct links to its pages, I have given an optional third
	argument $cm to the functions  require_login() and
	require_course_login(). Pages showing information about a
	particular course module now pass the course module object in this
	third argument. The login functions will then test if either the
	course module is visible or the user is a teacher. If neither is
	the case then the user is redirected to the course homepage after
	being shown a message "Sorry, this activity is currently hidden".
	
	(While I was at it I also turned the autologinguests off for most
	module pages, except on the index.php pages and the view.php pages
	for those modules that allow guests)

2005-02-13 Sunday 05:41  gustav_delius

	* type/: directory/directory.html, file/file.html, html/html.html,
	text/text.html: 
	
	Activities can now be hidden/shown from the activity editing page.
	Also for modules that know about groups the groupmode can be set
	from there. See bug 2533. This required adding to the mod.html
	files calls to new functions print_visible_setting() and
	print_groupmode_setting() which are combined in
	print_standard_coursemodule_settings().
	
	The visibility of coursemodules is now always set through the
	function set_coursemodule_visible() in order to make sure that the
	associated events get updated in the calendar appropriately.
	
	If moving a coursemodule to a hidden section then the module is set
	to hidden as well and its events are hidden in the calendar.
	
	If deleting a coursemodule its events are deleted from the
	calendar.
	
	The function choose_from_menu() has an extra optional argument
	$disabled which, when set to true, will disable the menu.
	
	For the sake of consistency the function set_groupmode_for_module
	has been renamed to set_coursemodule_groupmode and the functions
	show_course_module() and hide_course_module() have been combined to
	set_coursemodule_visible().

	to this point
	
	The biggest changes here are the fixes for HTML editor in all
	standard modules

2004-06-03 Thursday 21:07  moodler

	* details.php, mod.html, version.php: 
	
	OK, for bug fixes this is a pretty big checkin!!   :-/
	
	I finally was able to see the HTML Editor bug in IE/XP that
	everyone was talking about, and it's a very serious bug as it makes
	Moodle 1.3 almost unusable for these people.  :-(  :-(
	
	So, I eventually found out that the problem is that the Javascript
	that attaches the editor has troubles when it is embedded within
	the table						    that
	course/mod.php puts around the mod.html forms in each module. 
	(Only in IE and only sometimes, mind you).
	
	While testing I also had a good look at a long standing issue which
	is the inconsistency of the mod.html forms when using the editor.
	
	So, to fix both I decided to put the HTML editor calls OUTSIDE the
	mod.html in the mod.php file.  This means that all modules get the
	HTML editor by default on all text areas during activity module
	setup by default.
	
	I've been running through this for the past few hours and it seems
	pretty stable now and a lot more consistent, so I'm checking it in
	as big fix towards the Moodle 1.3.1 we have to have.
	
	Unfortunately it also means the API has changed a bit  ... I had to
	update all the module dependencies to this exact version (or
	later).
	
	Please test this "stable" version hard using the standard modules
	only and I'll merge these changes over to the trunk in a day or so
	and update all known third-party modules.

	This code contributed by Howard Miller.  Thanks!

2003-04-29 Tuesday 21:51  moodler

	* view.php: 
	
	Some tidying up - too much thesis wool in the head

2003-04-29 Tuesday 21:31  moodler

	* view.php: 
	
	Images, when displayed as resources, are now centered and
	controlled by a new style resourceimage

2003-04-25 Friday 01:05  moodler

	* details.php: 
	
	Default value for alltext variable

2003-04-24 Thursday 23:25  stronk7

	* index.php: 
	
	Changed to show the hidden resources dimmed (bug #364)

2003-04-23 Wednesday 23:01  moodler

	* details.php: 
	
	Got a bit slash-happy

2003-04-23 Wednesday 22:50  moodler

	* details.php: 
	
	some HTML tags made a bit more XHTMLish

2003-04-12 Saturday 11:42  moodler

	* details.php, mod.html: 
	
	Don't pass alltext from mod.html to details.php ... more efficient
	this way

2003-03-12 Wednesday 16:02  moodler

	* view.php: 
	
	Making a consistent download link for uploaded resources (same as
	web page)

2003-03-12 Wednesday 15:36  moodler

	* view.php: 
	
	Modified Greg's work to:
	
	  - rename the main_frame variable to framename, because it
	       - might have caused some confusion
	       - none of the global variables have underscores
	  - put the config in the config table, with a default of _top

2003-03-12 Wednesday 05:35  gregb_cc

	* view.php: 
	
	This is a first attempt to make moodle frame safe.
	
	I've added the variable CFG->main_frame to config-dist.php, and
	replaced _top targets with the variable in all the php files.  HTML
	files, like those in the documentation, have not been modified, as
	they are not (yet) parsed.
	
	The variable should probably get moved into the config table, and
	get some documentation.
	
	I've also included, but commented out, a slight change in
	weblib.php, which would guarantee that messages would be seen
	before redirecting the user (unless delay intentionally set to 0
	when redirect is used).

2003-01-15 Wednesday 18:55  moodler

	* view.php: 
	
	
	Displayed time formats are now stored in lang files (see the new
	strftime* strings) so they can be customised per language

2003-01-05 Sunday 22:19  moodler

	* details.php, index.php, view.php: 
	
	Clean sweep through all the important changing all include(),
	include_once() and require() to require_once()

2003-01-05 Sunday 18:10  moodler

	* lib.php, view.php: 
	
	Make frame width a variable

2003-01-05 Sunday 14:45  moodler

	* details.php: 
	
	OK a number of small changes here.
	
	Firstly, I'm replacing all use of old-style global variables like
	$HTTY_REFERER with their new-style equivalent
	$_SERVER["HTTP_REFERER"] Also using $_POST instead $HTTP_POST_VARS 
	etc
	
	Secondly, if gdversion == 0 (ie GD is not installed) then:
	
	 - users are not even allowed to upload new images
	 - graphs now just print a message instead of failing.
	
	this allows Moodle to still be used even if GD is not present

2003-01-02 Thursday 22:49  moodler

	* details.php: 
	
	buggy_referer is dead!	 Long live buggy_referer!
	
	Should be fixed now.  As a bonus, I've removed all the uses of
	HTTP_POST_VARS from all scripts.
	
	All forms should use the new data_submitted() function to collect
	form data (it does the match_referer thing internally now).
	
	Much nicer.

2003-01-01 Wednesday 21:17  moodler

	* mod.html: 
	
	Robustness fixes

2002-12-30 Monday 23:47  moodler

	* details.php: 
	
	Little robustness fixes

2002-12-24 Tuesday 15:01  moodler

	* details.php, lib.php, view.php: 
	
	Added new "Program" resource type, which allows Moodle to cooperate
	with external web applications by passing info about the current
	session to them.
	
	Code contributed by Mark Kimes.

2002-12-23 Monday 19:47  moodler

	* db/postgres7.sql: 
	
	More fixes for postgreSQL etc

2002-12-23 Monday 17:39  moodler

	* lib.php, version.php: 
	
	Changes throughout Moodle to remove any reserved words from the
	Moodle tables.
	
	ie user -> userid in many tables, plus in user_students    start ->
	starttime and end -> endtime
	
	I've just done all this as carefully as I could ... I don't think I
	missed anything but it's pretty intensive work and I'd be fooling
	myself if I didn't think I'd missed a couple.
	
	Note that this version should pretty much be able to bootstrap
	itself using PostgreSQL now ... but this is untested

2002-12-20 Friday 22:44  moodler

	* db/mysql.sql: 
	
	Many many changes lumped in here ... not finished yet either.
	
	Basically all the Database functions are in lib/datalib.php and the
	web functions are all in lib/weblib.php, so moodlelib.php is much
	thinner than it was.
	
	Data functions have been extended ... most old calls will still
	work, but now many more SQL commands can be performed using the
	datalib functions rather than using SQL.  I'm currently moving
	through the whole tree replacing SQL calls or at least
	concentrating them in one section of mod/xxx/lib.php
	
	Still working on forums, quizzes, surveys, resources.
	
	The tree is currently not full working ... some things are
	half-completed ... will resume tomorrow.

2002-12-15 Sunday 10:41  moodler

	* db/: postgres7.php, postgres7.sql: 
	
	Database and upgrade files for PostgreSQL 7 support!

2002-12-13 Friday 17:06  moodler

	* details.php, mod.html: 
	
	New consistent help buttons for textarea fields throughout all
	modules

2002-11-10 Sunday 22:03  moodler

	* view.php: 
	
	Use #defines for resource types ... just esthetics

2002-11-10 Sunday 16:43  moodler

	* index.php: 
	
	Added navmenu in more places

2002-11-10 Sunday 15:37  moodler

	* view.php: 
	
	Changes to enable jumping between activity modules, using a new
	menu in the upper-right corner.   Caution: Not well tested at this
	stage.

2002-10-17 Thursday 22:28  moodler

	* lib.php: 
	
	Changed string neverread to neverseen

2002-10-17 Thursday 22:03  moodler

	* details.php, icon.gif, index.php, lib.php, mod.html, version.php,
	view.php, db/mysql.php, db/mysql.sql: 
	
	
	
	***NOTE NOTE NOTE
	**********************************************************
	
	THIS IS A BIG CHANGE!
	
	I've renamed the "reading" module to "resource".
	
	This meant changing quite a few references throughout Moodle.
	
	The automatic upgrade process should work OK (it worked OK on my
	development server) and there shouldn't be any problems.
	
	BUT PLEASE PROCEED WITH CAUTION AND KEEP BACKUPS OF EVERYTHING
	UNTIL I HAVE A FEW MORE TESTS!	 If you upgrade please let me know.
	
	One thing that will break are any hard-coded links within forum
	messages.
	
	What I will be doing to fix this on my apache server is to add this
	to httpd.conf:
	
	Redirect /mod/reading/ http://moodle.com/mod/resource/
	
	Sorry about any inconvenience, but it's better this is done sooner
	than later.
