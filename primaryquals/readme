Using the Students Main Quals Import System

MIS will provide an Excell sheet witht eh following headers:

STEM_Student_ID
NOTIONAL_NVQ_LEVEL_CODE

PLP main qual type

This is needs to be saved as a csv
The csv is then put in the primaryquals folder in moodle (ie. s-moodle\C$\xampplite\htdocs\moodle\primaryquals)
Then run the import page form the site (ie. http://s-moodle.midkent.ac.uk/primaryquals/import_quals.php)

This will then scan through the csv and import or edit the records as needed.

Records in green are new records
Records in red are ones being updated
