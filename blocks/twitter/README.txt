Twitter block - by Dan Attwood - Affilited with Midkent College, Kent, UK


Introduction

Adding the block to a course will list all users (students and teachers) on that course with a twitter id in the block

You are then able to type in a message limited to 100 characters and press tweet it. The message will then be sent out as a direct message to all listed users

The message is limited to 100 characters to allow space for the twitter username and syntax needed in order for the module to send out the direct message.


Installation
