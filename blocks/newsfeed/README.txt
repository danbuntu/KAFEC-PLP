This is the newsfeed block. It supports locally-created Atom feeds 
and can import external Atom and RSS feeds, all of which can be 
aggregated together and displayed in a block within Moodle courses.

Before you start
=================

This block currently installs on Moodle 1.9 stable branch ONLY.


1. Installation
===============

Copy the folder 'newsfeed' into your Moodle's 'blocks' folder. Then visit
the /admin ('notifications') page in your web browser. The block should install
and become available.
 
 
2. Release notes
================

It's very easy to delete a newsfeed by clicking the X on the block, but doing
so doesn't 'really' delete the posts. This is sort of a bug but... Anyhow 
just be aware that old junk may stick around in the database. Shouldn't cause 
problems. And if somebody does delete a newsfeed by accident, it is possible
to get it back. (With quite some effort and several manual SQL queries.)
.

3. Support etc
==============

Documentation of a sort is included here! See the Word document 
old.newsfeed.doc. This has not been updated through several versions though, 
so may be well out of date - sorry.

If you need support, please try to figure it out for yourself, look
at the code, or try asking in Moodle forums. If all else fails you
can contact us but we may not have time to support you. 

If you want to make small enhancements to the system or have ideas
for larger enhancements, please get in touch with us.

this address as a general OU contact, please don't - we have about 
five thousand employees and the chance that I'm the right one, or 
that I know who is, is approximately zero. :) For general OU contacts
