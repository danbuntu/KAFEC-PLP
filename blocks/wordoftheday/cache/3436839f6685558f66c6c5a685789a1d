<p><span style="font-family:georgia, palatino;font-size:medium;color:#ff0000;">I'd just like to welcome you all to the MKC Forums where you can pretty much just talk about anything you want to. We have separate areas developed for different topics of conversation, but if you have something to talk about that doesn't really fit in the existing forums, or you think deserves its own section, don't hesitate to suggest it to one of the team members below.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:georgia, palatino;font-size:medium;color:#ff0000;">Although the forums are hosted by the college, it is quite rare that staff members will get involved, which is why they've asked Alex Winfield and I to help out. It's a student environment and it's best kept that way. The only time that anyone will really get in touch with you about a post is if you've broken the rules, or if it's something that you think the college could work on that we've all picked up on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:georgia, palatino;font-size:medium;color:#ff0000;">So, just a brief introduction from me: My name's James, and I am an A-Level student in the college in my second year, studying English Language and Literature, Government and Politics, Communication and Culture and History. I co-edit the Medway Mag with Hannah Davies, the editor, and am also the Media and Communications Executive Officer on the Student Union. I will be working with Alex to keep these forums a friendly atmosphere for you,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:georgia, palatino;font-size:medium;color:#ff0000;">If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask Alex Winfield, Jo Carter or myself.</span></p>
