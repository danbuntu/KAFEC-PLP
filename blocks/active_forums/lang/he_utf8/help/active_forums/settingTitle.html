<h1>Why Set the Title?</h1>

<p>There can be multiple instances of the Active Forums block. You may want to show a different time period for active forum discussions in same course. For example, in one block you may want to show dicussions that have been most active over the duration of the course, while in another block you may want to show recently active discssions. For this reason you can override the default title and set a more appropriate block title for each instance.</p>
